# ML Label

A prototype bounding box annotation tool written in SwiftUI. Annotate a set of images and export a JSON list ready for [Create ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/createml/building-an-object-detector-data-source) model training.

### ‚úÖ What it Has*
- Drag and drop image import
- Editable Bounding Boxes
- JSON export in Create ML compatible format
- Save and resume with .mlset files

### ‚ùå What it‚Äôs Missing 
- Ability to delete images & classes
- Undo functionality
- Search/sort functionality
- Ability to export annotations in different formats
- Grouping instances of class labels
- Auto labeling via user-uploaded CoreML models

### üìù Known Issues (the fix list)
- Thumbnails need to be downsized to reduce memory footprint
- Zooming in on an image (via AppKit‚Äôs `NSScrollView`) breaks any SwiftUI buttons within the view
- JSON `annotation` objects have an extraneous id parameter

## Installation
